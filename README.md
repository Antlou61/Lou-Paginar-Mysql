This PHP package, called "Lou Paginar Mysql", provides a reusable and organized way to implement pagination for data retrieved from a MySQL database. It consists of two main components:

The main advantages are:
1.	Encapsulation: 
Database connection and paging logic are encapsulated within classes, making the code more organized and reusable.
2.	Centralized logic: 
All paging-related code is in one place, making it easy to maintain and modify.
3.	Simplified use:
 DatabasePaginationWrapper simplifies the pagination deployment process by requiring minimal code in the main application file.
4.	Clean code:
 The code is well structured and commented, making it easy to understand.
5.	Reusable: 
Classes can be easily reused in other projects.
6.	Clear separation of concerns: 
Database connection and paging logic are separated into different classes.

In essence, this package is a well-designed, object-oriented solution for adding pagination to PHP applications that interact with MySQL databases.


DatabasePaginationWrapper class:
Objetive: 
This class acts as a wrapper, encapsulating the database connection and paging logic. It simplifies the process of connecting to the database, retrieving paginated results, and displaying pagination links.

Features:
1.	Database Connection: Handles connection to MySQL database using mysqli.
2.	Error handling: checks for connection errors and terminates execution if an error occurs.
3.	Pagination Integration: Creates an instance of the Pagination class to manage the pagination logic.

Méthods:
•	ExibirResultados():
  o	Takes an SQL query as input.
  o	Retrieves the paginated results from the database using the Paginacao
  o	Displays pagination links (First, Previous, page numbers, Next, Last).
  o	Returns the result set for the current page. 

•	FecharConexao(): Closes the connection to the database.

•	Constructor:
  o	Takes as arguments the database connection parameters (host, user, password, database name) and the number of results per page. 
  o	Establishes connection to the database.
  o	Initializes the Pagination object.


Paginação class:
Objective: 
This class handles the main paging logic. Calculates the total number of pages, determines the current page and generates the pagination links.

Méthods 
•	obterResultados():
  o	Takes an SQL query as input.
  o	Counts the total number of results that match the query.
  o	Calculates the total number of pages
  o	Determines the OFFSET of the current
  o	Add ORDER BY id DESC and LIMIT clauses to the query to retrieve only results from the current page.
  o	Executes the modified query and returns the result set.

•	getLinks():
  o	Generates HTML links for pagination (First, Previous, page numbers, Next, Last).
  o	Constructs the URLs for each link by including the page parameter in the query string (e.g. index.php?page=2
  o	Returns links as a string, separated by " | ".

•	Constructor:
  o	Takes as arguments the database connection object and the number of results per page.
  o	Sets the number of results per page
  o	Determines the current page from the $_GET['page'] parameter (defaults to 1 if not defined).


Operation (em index.php)
  •	Includes the paginate.php file, making the classes available.
  •	Database connection details (host, user, password, database name) and number of results per page are defined.
  •	A DatabasePaginationWrapper object is created, passing configuration details to its constructor.
  •	 An SQL query is defined (for example, SELECT * FROM noticias
  •	The wrapper's exibirResultados() method is called, passing the query. 
  •	Retrieves paged results.
  •	Displays pagination links.
  •	Returns the result set for the current page.
  •	Iterates through the result set and displays the data for each row.
  •	Close connection.
